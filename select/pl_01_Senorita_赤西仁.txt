(Whoa, whoa… Whoa te queiro)
(Whoa, whoa… Whoa te queiro)
I remember the first time
You walked by and caught my eye
I had to meet ya
Senorita
Though we met a couple times
Girl you still been on my mind
I can't delete ya
Girl I still be thinkin' bout
Those nights that you were with me
The party in Miami
So that's why now I'm coming back
To see ya, to find ya
Girl I know that you remember
The night when I got ya
I'm tryin' to do it all again
*
Say senorita can I meet ya
Tonight cuz I'm tryin' to freak ya (whoa)
Complete ya (whoa)
And please ya (whoa)
Girl all I want is you (te queiro)
And when I reach ya
We can leave out
To the beach house in Costa Rica (whoa)
With me girl (whoa)
You and me girl (whoa)
Cuz all I want is you (te queiro)
La chica
Where can I reach ya
Babe I been searchin' for you
All over the place
So girl where could you be right now
I need to see that smile
Her long ass hair and sexy eyes
Will make you faint
I swear you so amazing
You so amazing
Baby different from any girl I ever met before
I can't wait to please ya
That sexy body
The way you throw that booty on me
And you make it go
Bump, bump, bump, bump
Those nights that you were with me
The party in Miami
So that's why now I'm coming back
To see you, to find ya
Girl I wanna treat your body right
Up under candle light
Girl I'mma lay you on your back
And go down down
*Repeat
