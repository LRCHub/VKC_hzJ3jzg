[00:15.31] I love it when you call me señorita
[00:19.39] I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
[00:23.47] But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
[00:26.59] It's true, la-la-la
[00:28.51] Ooh, I should be runnin'
[00:30.60] Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

[00:33.22] Land in Miami
[00:35.19] The air was hot from summer rain

[00:44.43] It felt like ooh-la-la-la (Yeah, no)
[01:02.43] 
[00:49.35] Sapphire moonlight
[00:51.60] We danced for hours in the sand
[00:53.71] Tequila Sunrise
[00:55.74] Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
[01:00.80] It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah
[01:16.30]

[01:38.88] Locked in the hotel
[01:40.88] There's just some things that never change
[01:43.05] You say we're just friends
[01:44.94] But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la
[01:50.39] 'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
[01:52.24] Don't ya let me fall, oh
[01:55.01] Ooh, when your lips undress me
[01:57.19] Hooked on your tongue
[01:59.05] Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly, don't stop
[02:20.05]

[02:48.75] 
[02:37.44] All along I've been coming for ya (For you)
[02:41.62] And I hope it meant something to you (Ooh)
